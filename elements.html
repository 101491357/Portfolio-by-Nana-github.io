										<h2>Discover the Story Behind NANA ADWOA AFFUM</h2>
										<p>I am Nana Adowa Affum, affectionately known as NANA in the Canadian community. Hailing from Ghana, i bring a vibrant spirit and a deep sense of humor wherever i go.

My warm personality and genuine love for connecting with others, makes me undoubtedly a people's person who spreads joy wherever I go. </p>

										<h3>INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS</h3>
										<p>I have always had a passion for analytical reasoning and numbers, which was reflected in my
											undergraduate studies, where I majored in psychology and also took statistics courses. I even
											taught myself a computer programming language through YouTube and created a website.
											However, it was during my employment at Nestle (Central and West Africa) that my interest in
											data-oriented work and data-based reasoning deepened. I saw such great potential in this area
											not only for the business, but for myself to differentiate from my peers.
											While working in the human resources department, I realized the importance of using human
											resources analytics in making decisions related to hiring, training/development,
											benefits/compensation, and employee motivation. This realization became even more apparent
											when I was transferred to the financial service department and was involved in transactional
											procurement processes. I saw how advanced analytics skills could help in modeling processes
											for organizing and interpreting data to minimize errors.
											I became interested in becoming a senior-level manager who could use data to make fact-based
											decisions for the company. This interest was further reinforced when I was made the
											Automation Spoc in the procurement unit, where I received training in design thinking, power
											automate, and other data-related courses.However, I realized that my work experience alone was inadequate to reach my career goals
											and advancing within my company. I needed to enhance my skills and knowledge to fast-track
											my career progression. This realization first prompted me to pursue a Master of Business
											Administration (MBA) program and i am currently studying analytics for business decision in GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE</p>
									
										<h4>Work Experience</h4>
										<p>I have over 5 years working experience at Nestle Central and Western Africa and my work allowed me to work with difference suboffices on diverse business issues.  My primary roles involved improving the payroll and procurement systems across the region, but these were all done with a marketing lens, to ensure that Nestle remained a market leader in that area.  
											I have a track record of being dependable and using initiative to proactively solve problems in the workplace. Working with different teams, we found solutions that helped to improve overall KPIs in the region. Due to the roles that I played in different successful projects, I was allowed to organize training programs for officials in the region to ensure that Nestle achieved first time rights in the region for different products.  I also have experience using Microsoft Office Applications, SAP, Power Bi, and SUCCESSFACTORS, and I have SQL certification.
