										<h2>CAREER JOURNEY</h2>
										<p>"Over half a decade of versatile experience across multiple roles and industries." </p>

									<header>
										<h3>Special Projects Undertaken</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Embarked on a project that reduced time spent on creating purchase orders from 188.8 hours monthly to 23.6 hours.</li>
    <li>Used design thinking in a project that helped to identify challenges in GR/IR (Goods Receipt/Invoice Receipt). Strategies suggested allowed the Eastern and South African Region Nestle offices to achieve their KPIs.</li>
    <li>Led a project team to implement a swift payroll payment system for Nestle Nigeria. The system enabled the centralized Nestle Business Services in Ghana to pay Nestle Nigeria employees directly.</li>
    <li>Trained selected officials from the Central and Western Africa Nestle Region to apply a marketing lens in operations to remain the market leader in the region.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with the Toronto police to examine collisions in the Toronto area and come up with fresh approaches to handle these collisions using SAS VIYA.</li>
</ul>

										<h4>Work Experience</h4>
										<p>I have over 5 years working experience at Nestle Central and Western Africa and my work allowed me to work with difference suboffices on diverse business issues.  My primary roles involved improving the payroll and procurement systems across the region, but these were all done with a marketing lens, to ensure that Nestle remained a market leader in that area.  
											I have a track record of being dependable and using initiative to proactively solve problems in the workplace. Working with different teams, we found solutions that helped to improve overall KPIs in the region. Due to the roles that I played in different successful projects, I was allowed to organize training programs for officials in the region to ensure that Nestle achieved first time rights in the region for different products.  I also have experience using Microsoft Office Applications, SAP, Power Bi, and SUCCESSFACTORS, and I have SQL certification.
